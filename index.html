        Mali is a landlocked country in West Africa, formally known as the Republic of Mali. Mali is Africas eighth-largest </br>
         country, with little over 1,240,000 square kilometers, and has a population of 19.1 million people. </br>
        
        The name Mali is taken from the name of the Mali Empire. The name means “the place where the king lives and carries a </br>
         connotation of strength”. Well, we're about to see how much of this strength is put into the country's cuisine. </br>
        
        Malian official language is French, which is the result of 68 years of European colonization. Despite the fact that French is  </br>
         Malian official language, only about 5% to 10% of the population speaks it. Mali is home to a diverse range of ethnic groupings  </br>
          and tribes, each of which speaks a different indigenous language some of which include; Bambara, Bomu, Bozo, Dogon, Fulfulde,  </br>
          Hassaniya Arabic, Mamara, Maninkakan, Soninke, Songhay, Syenara, Tamasheq, Xaasongaxango.
